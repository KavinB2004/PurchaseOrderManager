# PurchaseOrderManager
• Implemented a multi-threaded order processing system in Java, improving order processing time through concurrent file processing and thread synchronization, resulting in faster data aggregation and output generation.
  <br>
• Prompted user to provide various inputs, including the item data file name, whether to use multiple threads, the number of orders, the base filename for orders, and the results filename.
  <br>
• Utilized data structures like HashMap and TreeMap to manage and aggregate item data, leading to improved data retrieval speed and efficient memory usage in processing large datasets.
  <br>
• Optimized file I/O operations by streamlining order data extraction, resulting in a reduction in processing time and enhancing the scalability of the application for large-scale data sets.
